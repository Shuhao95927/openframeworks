# Project 1 - Stop the World

## Project concept
I'd like to make an animation based on the song Stop The World from the musical Come From Away.
Users can have some simple interactions with the charater (e.g. moving charatcers, interacting with the scene and other characters, changing the scenes)

Here is the design for the two main characters <br/>
