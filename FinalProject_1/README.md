# Project 1 - Stop The World

## Project concept
I'd like to make an animation based on the song **_Stop The World_** from the musical **_Come From Away_**. This song tells the inner dialogue of two people who like each other when they walk to The Dover Fault.

Users can have some simple interactions with the charater (e.g. moving charatcers, interacting with the scene and other characters, changing the scenes)

Here is the design for the two main characters and the main scenes<br/>
